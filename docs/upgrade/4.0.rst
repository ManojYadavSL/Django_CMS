###################
4.0.0 release notes
###################

This release of django CMS is a complete rewrite of the core, hugely simplyfying what django-cms does
out of the box. The main reasons for the changes:
    - Limitations with publishing, where only 2 versions can ever exist
    - Too many "opinions" of how parts of the CMS should work baked in

.. warning:: Upgrading from previous versions

    4.0.0 introduces some changes that **require** action if you are upgrading
    from a previous version. Please read :ref:`upgrade-guide-4.0.0` for a step-by-step guide to the
    process of upgrading from 3.5+ to 4.0.0

How to upgrade to 4.0.0
*********************

It is currently recommended to start new projects on django-cms 4.0.0. The changes from
django-cms 3.x to 4.x are so different that only 3rd party utilities can assist with the
migration such as `djangocms-4-migration` https://pypi.org/project/djangocms-4-migration/.

Please refer to the guidance within the aforementioned package to perform a migration between projects.
