*******************
What's new in 3.4.2
*******************

Bug Fixes
=========

* Compatibility for Django-1.10: Removed deprecated argument ``current_app`` on invocation of
  ``TemplateResponse``.
* Added a deprecation warning to method ``render_plugin()`` in class ``CMSPluginBase``.
* Since ``get_parent_classes()`` became a classmethod, do not instantiate plugin before invocation.
* Removed a few confusing and useless code parts.
