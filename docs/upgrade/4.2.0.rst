Backward incompatible changes in 4.2
====================================

Wizards
-------

The wizard system's urls have been moved to the placeholder admin. As a
consequence it's reverse name has changed from ``cms_wizard_create`` to
``admin:cms_wizard_create``. If you are accessing the the create wizard url
directly in your project you will need to update the reverse name.
