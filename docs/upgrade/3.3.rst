3.3 release notes
#################

django CMS 3.3 has been planned largely as a consolidation release, to build on the progress made
in 3.2 and pave the way for the future ones.

The largest major change is dropped support for Django 1.6 and 1.7, and Python 2.6 followed
by major code cleanup to remove compatibility shims.

.. _whats_new_3.3:

*****************
What's new in 3.3
*****************

* Set the default value of CMSPlugin.position to 0 instead of null
* Management commands has been completely refactored for better consistency (see
  `backward_incompatible_3.3`_ for details)
* Introduction of the method `get_cache_expiration` on CMSPluginBase to be used
  by plugins for declaring their rendered content's period of validity.
* Introduction of the method `get_vary_cache_on` on CMSPluginBase to be used
  by plugins for declaring ``VARY`` headers.


.. _backward_incompatible_3.3:

****************
Upgrading to 3.3
****************

A database migration is required because the default value of CMSPlugin.position was set to 0 instead of null.

Please make sure that your current database is consistent and in a healthy state,
and **make a copy of the database before proceeding further.**

Then run::

    python manage.py migrate
    python manage.py cms fix-tree


*****************************
Backward incompatible changes

Management commands
===================

Management commands uses now argparse instead of optparse, following the Django deprecation
of the latter API.

The commands behaviour has remained untouched.

Detailed changes:

 * commands now use argparse subcommand API which leads to slightly different help output
   and other internal differences. If you use the commands by using Django's ``call_command``
   function you will have to adapt the command invocation to reflect this.
 * some commands have been rename replacing underscores with hyphens for consistency
 * all arguments are now non-positional. If you use the commands by using Django's
   ``call_command`` function you will have to adapt the command invocation to reflect this.


Signature changes
=================

The signatures of the toolbar methods ``get_or_create_menu`` have a new kwarg
``disabled`` *inserted* (not appended). This was done to maintain consistency with
other, existing toolbar methods. The signatures are now:

 * ``cms.toolbar.items.Menu.get_or_create_menu(key, verbose_name, disabled=False, side=LEFT, position=None)``
 * ``cms.toolbar.toolbar.CMSToolbar.get_or_create_menu(key, verbose_name=None, disabled=False, side=LEFT, position=None)``

It should only affect developers who use kwargs as positional args.
