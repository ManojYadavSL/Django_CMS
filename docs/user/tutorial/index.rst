Tutorial

.. note::

    This is a new section in the django CMS documentation. Your feedback is very helpful to us. -
    join us on the #django-cms IRC channel on `freenode`_ or the `django-cms-developers`_ email
    list.

**It's strongly recommended that you follow this tutorial step-by-step.**

In each step you will do a practical task or tasks that reflect real-life steps in building a site,
and each task introduces you to a key feature or functionality that you will use again and again.

The tutorial has been designed to introduce you to the system in a methodical way, and each step
builds on the previous one.

In the tutorial you'll build a website for a bicycle repair service, using a full range of django
CMS functionality. You'll also learn how to manage information about such things as events, people,
news, jobs and more, all using dedicated applications that have been designed to integrate with
django CMS.

.. note:: **Touch-screen users**

    django CMS supports touch-screen interfaces, though there are currently some limitations in
    support. You will be able to complete the tutorial using a touch-screen device, but please
    consult :ref:`touch`, and see the notes on :ref:`device-support`.
