    In this tutorial, we use a pre-configured django CMS website on `Aldryn
    <https://aldryn.com/>`_, that includes a number of integrated applications give you a full
    introduction not just to the core CMS, but also to a realistic implementation of it as part of
    a complete website.

    All the functionality and applications in the tutorial are available even if you don't use
    Aldryn for your django CMS sites, and using Aldryn for the tutorial is completely free.

#.  Visit http://demo.django-cms.org/, and select *Get
    your free Aldryn account*.

    If you already have one, you'll be taken to the Control Panel, and you can skip to the next
    step.

    Otherwise it will only take a few minutes to set up your new account. Simply follow the steps.

#.  .. todo:: until the tutorial site is available, ask Dario for a link to a copy of it.

    In the Control Panel, select a *Add a new Project*, and when prompted opt for *xxxxx*. Follow
    the steps, until your new site has been deployed.

#.  To login to your new website, hit the |open-site| link on the dashboard.
