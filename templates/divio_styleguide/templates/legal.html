            <p class="lead">If you find a Divio Cloud powered site that you believe violates our terms of service, please report this immediately via our Divio Support. If you don’t feel like you want to agree to these terms of service – and therefore not being able
                to use our services – we strongly recommend to check out the open source projects <a href="http://django-cms.org/">django CMS</a>. We commit intensely to these projects and will continue to do so in the future. Thanks to the folks at
                <a href="http://automattic.com/about/">Automattic</a> for letting us officially steal their <a href="http://en.wordpress.com/tos/">terms of service</a> so we can invest our money into developers instead of lawyers. You really rock! Terms

                                invoices are sent each month. The invoice must be paid within 10 days. Invoices for Enterprise- and Training Services have to be paid full in advance.<br> A reduction of the contract fee is only possible in the case of
                                objective breaches of the contract and not for artistic or design-related reasons. In particular, dissatisfaction and aesthetic non-compliance with the service provided by Divio do not exempt the client from the payment
                                liability. If there are indications that the services of Divio do not fully correspond to the requirements and perceptions of the client, the client must inform Divio of this immediately. Until this notification is received,
                                the expenses incurred by Divio are considered to be accepted.</p>

                            <h5>Delivery Period</h5>
                            <p dir="ltr">All dates and delivery periods specified by Divio are only approximate without another explicit written agreement and are therefore considered to be non-binding. Even when binding date agreements have been made, if the delivery
                                is delayed, the obligation to provide compensation only exists in the case of intention and gross negligence by Divio. Inevitable or unforeseeable events and, in particular, delays on the part of the client, release Divio
                                from compliance with the agreed dates.</p>

                        <li>
                            <h5>Acceptance</h5>
                            <p dir="ltr">After notification of the creation of the order and the invitation to acceptance by Divio, acceptance must be given within one month. Late acceptance entitles Divio to submit an additional invoice. If the client refuses to
                                accept, Divio can grant an additional period of 14 days for mutual acceptance. If this additional period is not used, the order is considered to be accepted.<br> In the case of defects identified during acceptance, the
                                client only has a right to improvement or additional delivery within two months. The notice of defects must be brought within 10 days. After this time, the contract is considered to be approved. The improvement of basic
                                defects requires another acceptance.<br> The contractor retains the right to send the final invoice if the project delays are not their fault. The contractor also retains this right if the project cannot be placed online
                                for end-users through no fault of their own.</p>

                        period. Your continued use of our Services will be subject to the new terms. However, any dispute that arose before the changes shall be governed by the Terms (including the binding individual arbitration clause) that were in place
                        when the dispute arose. Your continued use of or access to the Website following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes acceptance of those changes. Divio may also, in the future, offer new services and/or features
                        through the Website (including, the release of new tools and resources). Such new features and/or services shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.</p>

                        your account (if you have one), you may simply discontinue using our Services. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if you have a Paid Services account, such account can only be terminated by Divio if you materially breach this Agreement
                        and fail to cure such breach within thirty (30) days from Divio’s notice to you thereof; provided that, Divio can terminate the Website immediately as part of a general shut down of our service. All provisions of this Agreement
                        which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

                        executive of Divio, or be posted by Divio as applicable. No response of you within thirty (30) days will constitute your tacit acceptance of the modified Terms.<br> If any part or provision of this Agreement shall be held to be
                        invalid or unenforceable, the other provisions of this Agreement shall nonetheless remain valid. In this case, the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be replaced (by court order, as the case may be) by a substitute provision
                        that best reflects the intentions of the Parties without being unenforceable, and each Party shall execute all agreements and documents required in this connection. The same shall apply in case of any gap in this Agreement.<br>                        This Agreement shall in all respects be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the substantive laws of Switzerland, to the exclusion of conflict of law principles and the UN Convention on the international sale of goods
                        (CISG). Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall exclusively be referred to the courts competent for the City of Zurich, Switzerland.<br> A waiver by either party of any term or condition of this Agreement
                        or any breach thereof, in any one instance, will not waive such term or condition or any subsequent breach thereof. You may assign your rights under this Agreement to any party that consents to, and agrees to be bound by, its terms
                        and conditions; Divio may assign its rights under this Agreement without condition. This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</p>
